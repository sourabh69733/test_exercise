You will also see any lint errors in the console.

First Logic page : src\components\firstPageCourse.js\
Second Logic course exercise page: src\components\secondPageCourse.js

To run project locally \
Clone the project, then run npm install and go to src\index.js, here I have both page components,so just uncomment one to check.

I have used Bootstrap library for CSS and React front-end library.
